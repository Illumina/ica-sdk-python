# AnalysisStepLogs

Contains references to the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) log streams of an analysis step. In this object both log streams could be provided in 2 different formats: as a WebSocket stream URL or as an ICA Data reference. The status of the analysis step determines which format is provided: a WebSocket URL during step execution, a Data reference after step execution. Note however that an analysis step might not expose log streams at all, which would result in this object being empty. 

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**std_out_data** | [**Data**](Data.md) |  | [optional] 
**std_out_stream** | **str** | A WebSocket URL for reading the standard output log stream. Might be closed by ICA as soon as the analysis step execution has finished. | [optional] 
**std_err_data** | [**Data**](Data.md) |  | [optional] 
**std_err_stream** | **str** | A WebSocket URL for reading the standard error log stream. Might be closed by ICA as soon as the analysis step execution has finished. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from icasdk.models.analysis_step_logs import AnalysisStepLogs

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AnalysisStepLogs from a JSON string
analysis_step_logs_instance = AnalysisStepLogs.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print AnalysisStepLogs.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
analysis_step_logs_dict = analysis_step_logs_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of AnalysisStepLogs from a dict
analysis_step_logs_form_dict = analysis_step_logs.from_dict(analysis_step_logs_dict)
